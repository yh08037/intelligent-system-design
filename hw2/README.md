## HW2

Simone Alberto Peirone provided very simple python code for learning single layer perceptron with IRIS dataset.

1) Download or cut-and-paste the code and run. Make sure that your results (plots) are the same as the attached png files. 

 

2. This example only shows 'Setosa' and 'Versicolour' classification. Modify the code for other combinations as well. 

hw02-1.py: Setosa vs Virginica

hw02-2.py: Versicolour vs Virginica

 

 

3. The wine data is a 3-classification problem with 13 features. The original data can be found at:

 

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine

 

Using the attached wine.csv, implement perceptron learning for the classification of 

hw02-3.py: wine type 1 vs 2

hw02-4.py: wine type 1 vs 3

hw02-5.py: wine type 2 vs 3

 

Assume that "wine.csv" is at the same folder.

 

Requirements and submission:

 

1. First 5 lines should have your student ID, your name, file name, platform, and a list of required package(s). 

2. submit a zip file of hw02-1.py ~ hw02-5.py (5 python source codes). Do not include any other files (10% penalty)

 

Grading:

10% Basic score for submission

10% Correct in the first 5 lines

50% Executability and correctness of the output

30% Code readibility

Late submission deduction: 10% per hour
